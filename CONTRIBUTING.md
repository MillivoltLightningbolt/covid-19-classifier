# How to contribute?

We released the source code for our [covid-19-classifier](https://labs.deep-insights.ai/) intentionally as open source.
We believe in the power of the internet (that means you) to contribute and improve this project in order to help fight off COVID-19.

If you find any errors, please file a bug report via github's issue tracker.
You can also mail us directly at kaplan@deep-insights.ai.

Pull requests to the code are welcome.
Please for the project and create a pull request.
